## Milton & Wills (2004)

_It was once widely believed that classification without feedback was largely based on a single stimulus dimension in an array sort (Medin et al, 1987), but on the basis of overall similarity in a sequential sort (Regehr & Brooks, 1995). We showed that, even in the latter case, single-dimension classification is quite common, and its prevalence depends on the nature of the stimuli. We also showed what was then considered to be a paradoxical result - spatially integrated stimuli were more likely to be classified on the basis of a single dimension than spatially separated stimuli. This led up to propose the Dimmensional Summation hypothesis, starting a sequence of work beginning with Milton et al. (2008) and continuing for more than a decade (e.g. Wills et al., 2020)_.
