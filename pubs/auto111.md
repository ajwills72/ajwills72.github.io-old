## Milton & Wills (2004)

This paper came from Fraser's Ph.D. work. Originally, our goal was to seek evidence that pre-exposure led to an increase in overall similarity classification. In this, we were unsuccessful, and it would be more than 15 years until that particular project came to fruition (see Milton et al., 2020).
