The idea for Experiment 1 came from a discussion with Mike Aitken, but I guess the bar for authorship credit
was higher back then. Fergal Jones ran Experiment 1 as his undergraduate project, along with Howard Portess.
They were big Star Trek fans, and when I went in to debug the code, I found variables like 'Riker' and 'Troi'!
Experiment 2 was run by Fergal after he graduated and before he started his Ph.D, joining me and Steve Graham
in the same cold attic office in the William Hardy Building.
