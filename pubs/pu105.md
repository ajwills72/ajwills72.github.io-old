# Adpating to a response deadline in categorization

## Summary

_We react to a short deadline for a categorical decision with a selective non-linear adaptation: we reduce the mean, standard deviation, and skew of our reaction time distribution. Previous studies of the effect of a deadline potentially suffered from a missing data artifact, this study did not._

## Abstract

The effect of a response deadline on categorical decisions was investigated.
Time available for response was manipulated in the test phase, along with
stimulus difficulty.  Effects of these manipulations were observed in response
accuracy, and in the mean, standard deviation and skew of the reaction times.
The effects observed demonstrate that participants responded to the deadline in
an adaptive manner - reducing their reaction time to long-latency decisions
whilst leaving short latency decisions relatively unaffected.  A simple
connectionist model of categorical decisions (Wills & McLaren, 1997) is shown
to account for this behavior.
