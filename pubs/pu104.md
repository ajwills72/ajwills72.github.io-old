# Tests of the ratio rule in categorization

## Summary

_The ratio rule (Luce choice axiom) is not the correct model for categorical decisions; a Thurstonian choice model (implemented via lateral inhbition) provides a better account_.

## Abstract

Many theories of learning and memory (e.g., connectionist, associative, rational, exemplar
based) produce psychological magnitude terms as output (i.e., numbers representing the
momentary level of some subjective property). Many theories assume that these numbers
may be translated into choice probabilities via the ratio rule, also known as the choice axiom
(Luce, 1959) or the constant-ratio rule (Clarke, 1957). We present two categorization experiments employing artificial, visual, prototype-structured stimuli constructed from 12 symbols
positioned on a grid. The ratio rule is shown to be incorrect for these experiments, given the
assumption that the magnitude terms for each category are univariate functions of the
number of category-appropriate symbols contained in the presented stimulus. A connectionist winner-take-all model of categorical decision (Wills & McLaren, 1997) is shown to
account for our data given the same assumption. The central feature underlying the success
of this model is the assumption that categorical decisions are based on a Thurstonian choice
process (Thurstone, 1927, Case V) whose noise distribution is not double exponential in
form.
