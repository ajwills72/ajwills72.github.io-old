_It was often argued that pigeons show local-feature preference, while humans
show global-feature preference. In reality, we know that humans show local
preference when stimuli are sufficiently large, and that stimuli tend to be
large in pigeon experiments. Here we show that, for relatively small stimuli,
both species exhibit global-feature preference_.
