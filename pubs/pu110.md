# The role of category structure in determining the effects of stimulus preexposure on categorization accuracy

## Summary

_Stimulus preexposure can facilitate or retard subsequent category learning, dependent on stimulus structure. The fact that stimulus exposure can have the opposite effect to categorization of the same stimuli is difficult to accommodate in accounts that assume preexposure has its effects through a process of unsupervised categorization (e.g. Saksida, 1999)_. 

## Abstract

What are the effects of preexposure of stimuli on participantsâ€™ subsequent ability to categorizethem accurately? An experiment employing artificial, abstract, visual stimuli confirms that, for adult  humans,  the  effect  of  preexposure  is  dependent  upon  category  structure.  Whether preexposure has beneficial or detrimental effects is shown to be dependent on the way category examples are generated from the category base patterns. The results are predicted by salience reduction accounts of perceptual learning but may be problematic for stimulus differentiation accounts.
