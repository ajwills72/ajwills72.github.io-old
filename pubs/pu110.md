## Wills et al. (2004)

_Stimulus preexposure can facilitate or retard subsequent category learning,
dependent on stimulus structure. The fact that stimulus exposure can have the
opposite effect to categorization of the same stimuli is difficult to
accommodate in accounts that assume preexposure has its effects through a
process of unsupervised categorization (e.g. Saksida, 1999)_.
