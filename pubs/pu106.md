# Is competitive learning an adequate account of free classification?

## Summary

_We provide evidence for the presence of blocking in a free classification
task. This experiment was inspired by the observation that Rumelhart & Zipser's
(1986) model of unsupervised learning would not predict the presence of a
blocking effect._

## Abstract

Rumelhart & Zipser's (1986) competitive learning algorithm is an account of unsupervised learning and, as such, might be considered a potential model of free classification behavior in humans. However, selective learning effects (e.g. Dickinson, Shanks & Evenden, 1984) suggest that human learning, at least under conditions of feedback, may be better characterized by an error-correcting systems. An experiment is reported that provides preliminary evidence ofr the existence of a selective learning effect in free classification. Simulations indicate that Rumelhart & Zipser's algorithm does not provide an adequate account of the behavior observed, whilst an error-correcting variant of competitive learning does.
