# Perceptual learning and free classification

## Summary

_Pre-exposure to categorical stimuli can facilitate, retard, or have no effect, on subsequent free classification, depending on category structure; it also affects the number of categories formed. Supports McLaren-Kaye-Mackintosh model, and develops a methodology for studying free classificaiton. It also provides a demonstration that free classification is not an adequate model of perceptual learning (compare Saksida, 1999)._

## Abstract

Two experiments are reported that investigate the effects of stimulus preexposure on discrimination performance in a free classification task, using adult humans as subjects. In free
classification subjects are asked to put stimuli into gruops in any way that seems reasonable or
sensible to them. Experiment 1 shows that the effect of preexposure is contingent on stimulus
structure. Experiment 1b is the first demonstration of a retardation in learning as a consequence of simple preexposure in adult human subjects (previous demonstrations have relied
on incidental or masked preexposure). Experiment 2 further supports the conclusions of
Experiment 1 and extends them with the demonstration that stimulus similarity is a crucial
factor. Taken together, these experiments rule out a class of attention-based explanations of
the phenomena reported here. T he experiments also provide novel information about the
effects of preexposure. Preexposure can change the actual classifications subjects form in
addition to altering the rate at which they are formed. Implications of these results for
current theories of category formation and perceptual learning are considered.
