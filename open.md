# Open Computing at Plymouth University

This page lists free and open-source computing resources, with a particular focus on staff and students at Plymouth University, UK, using Linux.

Except where noted, all resources on, or linked from, this page are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

## Linux on your work machine

The university's preferred solution is that you run Linux as a virtual machine inside their normal Windows install on university-owned machines. They provide instructions on how to do this. In some cases, you may prefer or require direct (e.g. dual-boot) access to Linux. Obvious examples in psychology include: (a) neuroscience analysis on laptops (VMs are too memory-hungry and laptops too low in memory for this to be viable), (b) in a desktop machine, anything requiring direct access to the GPU. This is demonstrably possible, and permissible on a case-by-case basis (Profs. Rod Sheaff and Andy Wills are among current staff doing this)

Things to note:

- Backup your machine before doing this!

- IT support won't support your machine in Linux mode, any problems you have are your problems (but I can help).

- You may be asked to get the signature of a Senior Manager to approve your request. I am one of those, so you can get mine. Prof. Rod Sheaff is also happy to approve such requests.

- Don't leave it more than a few days without an email from TIS before you ring them up again and check progress.

- TIS may ask you to provide the installation media. If so, I'm happy to give you an Ubtuntu installation USB stick, for free.

- Don't give up, if you hit problems (including problems with ITS) just tell me and we'll get it unstuck together. 

## Internet access on Linux

- **eduroam** - WiFi for students, researchers, and educators at 10,000s of hotspots in over 70 countries (including PU campus).
  - [Instructions](open/pu-eduroam.pdf) for Linux at Plymouth University. 
    
- **Virtual Private Network** - Connect to the university's private network from outside campus (useful for remote desktop) using these [instructions](open/vpn-setup.pdf). 

## Two-factor authentication for Linux

The university's two-factor authentication system uses, by default, installation of a Microsoft closed-source authenticator app from the Play Store (Android) or the Apple equivalent. Here are two open-source alternatives:

- If you have an Android-based open-source device (e.g. a LineageOS tablet or phone), you can download FreeOTP+ from FDroid. 

- If you prefer a Linux desktop solution, you can use Authy on Ubuntu, following these [instructions](open/2FA.odt).

The university also requires you provide them with your mobile number. 

## Email and calendar on Linux

These [instructions](open/PU-evolution-setup.odt) cover how to set up the Evolution email/calendar sofware to access Office365 email and calendars at Plymouth University. Alternatively, these [instructions](open/PU-thunderbird-setup.odt) cover the same thing for Thunderbird. Alternatively, use the web interface, which works well on Linux.


## Printing from Linux

Here are some instructions for printing from a [wired](open/pharos-setup.pdf), or [wireless](open/wireless-setup.pdf), connection.
